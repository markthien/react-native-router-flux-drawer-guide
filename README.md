Ths purpose of this project is to show you how to implement **drawer sidemenu** using **react-native-router-flux**

I created a simple directory structure for simplicity purposes.

The main component is **App** and the rest of the components are inside **component folder**

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).

Download or clone this project into a folder and then enter

#### `npm start`

Have fun :)
